## A new paradigm in diagnosis of dental caries on the Children’s first permanent molar

Note that: The code and dataset will be released soon.

## Introduction
 In this paper, we propose a unified caries detection and assessment
(UCDA) framework to achieve a new paradigm in fully-automated diagnosis of dental caries on the
children’s first permanent molar. Meanwhile,we also present a novel children’s oral image database, namely “Child-OID", which
comprises 1,368 primary school children’s oral images with standard diagnostic annotations and labels, to
evaluate the effectiveness of our UCDA method.


## UCDA
The proposed UCDA framework is
composed of a ResNet-FPN based backbone network and
two task-specific subnetworks, i.e., region regression and
region classification subnetworks.

## Child-OID
We assembled a children’s oral images
database consisting of a total of 1,368 multi-view oral im-
ages from 342 children. Each belongs to one of four standard
image types: left palate, right palate, left mandible, and right
mandible.
