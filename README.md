#A new paradigm in diagnosis of dental caries on the Children’s first permanent molar

Note that: The code and dataset are being sorted out and are coming online.

## Introduction
 In this paper, we propose a unified caries detection and assessment
(UCDA) framework to achieve a new paradigm in fully-automated diagnosis of dental caries on the
children’s first permanent molar. Meanwhile,we also present a novel children’s oral image database, namely “Child-OID", which
comprises 1,368 primary school children’s oral images with standard diagnostic annotations and labels, to
evaluate the effectiveness of our UCDA method.
